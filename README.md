# Homebrew Tap

This is my collection of small utilities which I found to be useful,
which might not be popular enough to be included in the main Homebrew repository.


## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install Tenzer/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap Tenzer/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.


## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
